##SESSF Github Wiki: Automation for Stock Assessment

This Github repository hosts a number of R scripts designed to improve the repeatability and utility of assessment models and associated analyses used for stock assessment of key SESSF fisheries. 

The scripts described here are written for use with Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3, tested on Version 3.24U) and with the R package `r4ss`, version 1.23.5, which can be downloaded from the `r4ss` Github site: https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss. Scripts have been written and tested for use with SESSF stock assessments, with specific examples given using a 2015 example model for Jackass Morwong. The model used is not a real base-case model, nor a model used for assessment, it serves only as an example for using the R scripts described here. 

Further descriptions and a user guide for each of the current scripts, namely, `SS_Outputs.R`, `SS_LikeProf.R`, and `SS_Retro.R`, are provided on the [Wiki](https://github.com/mezo-research/sessf/wiki) page.
